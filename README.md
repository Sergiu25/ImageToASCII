# ImageToASCII
ImageToASCII its a site worked with html and css only the backend was made in python and i used the flask framework for the site.The first program was simply just a program where i put the path of the image and create and html page with the result and a txt file where it was a result.Then i was thinking, this is to exhausting every time i want to change the image i have to search the path for it and paste it in my program and this is how, I created the website for this program with the help of flask.

To be honest this is my first time using a framework and i am excited for this project, of course its a small project it does maybe 4 things but i enjoyed working on it and i really like it.

This is how the results should look like.
The concept behind the output and the logical thing behind it, is a for loop, if u go in app.py u should see i went first with a for loop in height and then i went with a for loop width, i am checking the brightness and mapping to characters in a controlled way.There is more tehnical stuff and things but i keep it low in this read me file.
